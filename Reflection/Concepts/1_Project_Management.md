# Web Scraping Project: Questions & Answers

A guide to defining and scoping your web scraping project.

---

## 1. Define the Purpose

**Q: What is the goal of this project?**  
A: Defining the goal ensures you only scrape data that directly supports your needs (e.g., product prices, job listings, news articles). Without this, you risk wasting time on irrelevant data.
### My Understanding:
Figuring out the goal to be focused to the most important things only to get the job done faster

**Q: Who will use the scraped data and for what?**  
A: Understanding the audience clarifies the format and level of detail required (e.g., researchers may need CSV files, while developers may need JSON or API outputs).

### My Understanding:
Understanding the client or audience i can think the level of the detail of doing things 

**Q: Is this a one-time scrape or ongoing/automated?**  
A: This determines project complexity. One-time scrapes can be quick, while ongoing scrapes require automation, error handling, and long-term maintenance.

### My Understanding:
Basically so i don't waste time building things like the maintainability, readability if only it is a one time project but in terms of on going scrape i can consider maintainability and readability so the next developer don't have much harder time

## 2. Define the Data Scope

**Q: What specific data do I need?**  
A: Helps avoid unnecessary scraping. Focus only on the key fields (e.g., title, price, link) that serve your project goals.
### My Understanding:
This is going back to the no. 1 Focusing only the key field and avoiding the unecessary data so you don't waste time 

**Q: Which websites or pages contain this data?**  
A: Identifying sources early helps you evaluate feasibility, complexity, and legality of scraping.
### My Understanding:
So i can handle the complexity either javascript , or high security like captchas and the legality because i can be sued by the website 

**Q: What’s the volume of data?**  
A: The scale affects storage and processing. Small datasets may fit in spreadsheets; large ones require databases or cloud storage.
### My Understanding:
The Scale and Proccessing require different skill so identifying the voulme of data is really necessary

**Q: Do I need historical data or only real-time snapshots?**  
A: Historical data needs archiving strategies, while real-time scraping requires frequent updates and monitoring.
### My Understanding:
I don't have experience on archiving and realtime scrapping honestly

## 3. Technical Considerations

**Q: How often should the data be updated?**  
A: Frequency drives infrastructure. Daily or weekly updates are light; real-time scraping needs robust, scalable systems.
### My Understanding:
The Frequency of Scrapping a thing need more robust and maybe how you can scale things so it really depends on the goal

**Q: How structured is the data on the site?**  
A: Structured data (tables, APIs) is easier to scrape than messy HTML or JavaScript-rendered content, which may need tools like Selenium or Playwright.
### My Understanding:
It will boil down how complex the data extraction of the website and the time of scrapping, data cleaning and data proccessing 

**Q: What tools/libraries will I use?**  
A: Tool choice affects development speed and scalability.  
- Small projects → `BeautifulSoup`, `Requests`  
- Large projects → `Scrapy`  
- Dynamic sites → `Selenium`, `Playwright`
### My Understanding:
This will greatly affect my Skills because there are many ways to scrape and the complexity of the website are depends on the tools i will use 

**Q: Where and how will I store the data?**  
A: Storage ensures usability. Options include CSV/JSON for small projects, or databases/cloud for larger pipelines.
### My Understanding:
Small projects is for CSV and JSON while Database and Cloud are for larger things depends on the client and what they want and this greatly affect my skills on how i handle things

## 4. Feasibility & Constraints

**Q: Does the website allow scraping?**  
A: Always check `robots.txt` and terms of service. Ignoring legal/ethical rules can result in bans or legal consequences.
### My Understanding:
respecting the robot.txt and also the term of service so we don't get a banned in the website

**Q: Is the site dynamic (heavily JavaScript-based)?**  
A: Affects scraper design. Static HTML is easy; dynamic content may require headless browsers or API analysis.
### My Understanding:
The Scraper can get complex if it is a dynamic website but if it is HTML website it will be easy so it boil down the tool i used 

**Q: Are there anti-scraping measures?**  
A: Rate limits, CAPTCHAs, and IP bans require strategies like rotating proxies, time delays, and stealth scraping techniques.
### My Understanding: 
Anti Scrapping measure can get the project complex and required a more skill and experience in how it do things 

**Q: Do I have enough resources to handle the data?**  
A: Scraping large datasets can overwhelm limited storage or compute. Plan infrastructure before starting.
### My Understanding: 
Planning the Infrastructure on where to put the data and where to run the scrapper because my laptop/computer can limit it

## 5. Output & Usage

**Q: What format should the data be in?**  
A: Choose the right format for downstream use (CSV for analysis, JSON for APIs, SQL for databases).

**Q: What will happen after the data is collected?**  
A: Scraped data usually needs cleaning, analysis, or visualization. Planning this step avoids unusable raw data.
### My Understanding: 
Taking the account for data transforming and cleaning because it will go back to the question of who are gonna use the data for what will they gonna do with it

**Q: Do I need to automate and maintain the scraper?**  
A: Websites change often. Long-term projects need monitoring, error handling, and regular updates to keep scrapers working.
### My Understanding: 
Website can change man so defining wether they gonna reuse the project is very useful thing to know to add error handling and making it more robust

## Example Project Definition

*"I want to scrape product prices (goal) from Amazon and eBay (scope: 2 websites), collecting product name, price, rating, and URL (data points), every 24 hours (frequency), store it in a PostgreSQL database (storage), for a price comparison dashboard (usage)."*

### Creating my Own Project Definition:
I want to scrape the skills required for an automation career/ mechatronics career (goal) from the Jora.com(Scope: 1 Website) collecting the name of the company, Role of the jobs, Location of the company, Job Description Extracting the hardskills every week(frequency), storing it in a csv files(storage) to know what is the relevant skill for automation/mechatronics career. but overall to build a portfolio to showcase my Scrapping Skills


# Web Scraping Project Workflow

A step-by-step process to plan, build, and maintain a scraping project.

---

## 1. Project Definition
- ✅ Define the **goal** (what problem am I solving with this data?).  
- ✅ Identify the **end users** (researchers, analysts, developers, business).  
- ✅ Decide if the scrape is **one-time** or **ongoing**.  

---

## 2. Data Scoping
- ✅ List the **specific fields** you need (e.g., title, price, URL).  
- ✅ Identify **target websites/pages** that contain this data.  
- ✅ Estimate the **data volume** (small, medium, very large).  
- ✅ Decide between **historical vs. real-time** data collection.  

---

## 3. Technical Planning
- ✅ Define the **update frequency** (daily, weekly, real-time).  
- ✅ Analyze the **site structure** (static HTML, API, or JavaScript-heavy).  
- ✅ Choose the right **tools/libraries** (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, Playwright).  
- ✅ Plan **data storage** (CSV, JSON, SQL database, cloud storage).  

---

## 4. Feasibility & Constraints
- ✅ Check **robots.txt** and terms of service for scraping rules.  
- ✅ Assess if the site has **dynamic content** (needs headless browser/API).  
- ✅ Check for **anti-scraping measures** (rate limits, CAPTCHAs, IP bans).  
- ✅ Ensure **resources** (storage, compute, bandwidth) are sufficient.  

---

## 5. Development & Testing
- ✅ Build a **prototype scraper** for a small dataset.  
- ✅ Add **error handling & logging**.  
- ✅ Test scraper on different pages/sections.  
- ✅ Validate that the scraped data matches your requirements.  

---

## 6. Data Processing & Usage
- ✅ Clean and normalize the data (remove duplicates, fix formatting).  
- ✅ Save/export in the correct **format** (CSV, JSON, DB).  
- ✅ Integrate with **analysis tools** (Excel, Python, BI dashboards).  
- ✅ Document the data pipeline.  

---

## 7. Automation & Maintenance
- ✅ Automate with **cron jobs, Airflow, or cloud functions**.  
- ✅ Add **retry logic** and backup storage.  
- ✅ Monitor scraper performance and website changes.  
- ✅ Update code if site structure changes.
