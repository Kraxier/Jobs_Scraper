# Q&A — How the 7 Planning Areas Shape Your Scraper (practical → actionable)

Below I've converted each planning area into short, copy-pasteable Q & A pairs you can use in docs, client messages, or your mental checklist.

---

## 1) Project Definition → Overall Architecture & Scope

**Q: How does the project definition affect my scraper architecture?**  
A: The goal (**one-time vs ongoing, simple vs production**) determines whether you write a throwaway script or design a full pipeline with scheduling, alerting, and handover (**CSV vs API**).

**Q: What concrete action should I take based on project definition?**  
A: If **one-time** → build a simple script that outputs CSV/JSON.  
If **ongoing** → design an **ingest → transform → store** pipeline, add a scheduler, monitoring, and acceptance criteria for tests.

**Q: What acceptance criteria should I define?**  
A: A short measurable target (example: **“95% of records have title, price, url; daily update within 24 hours”**). Use this for QA and client sign-off.

---

## 2) Data Scoping → Selectors, Schema, Storage

**Q: Why does data scoping matter for my scraper?**  
A: It defines the schema, parser complexity, validation rules, and storage choice — which impacts every line of code and infra decision.

**Q: What practical steps do I implement from data scoping?**  
A: Create a **JSON schema or ORM model** for records, implement parser functions per field (with validation and sanitization), and pick storage based on scale (**CSV/Sheets → Postgres → S3/BigQuery**).

**Q: How do I pick storage?**  
- **Small/simple** → CSV or Google Sheets  
- **Moderate** → Postgres/SQLite  
- **Large/analytical** → S3 + Parquet + BigQuery/Elasticsearch  

---

## 3) Technical Planning → Tools, Libraries, Rendering

**Q: How do site technical details change my tooling choice?**  
A: If the site is **static HTML** you can use **requests + BeautifulSoup** or **Scrapy**. If **JS renders important data** you need a headless browser (**Playwright/Selenium**).

**Q: What concrete engineering choices follow this?**  
A: Choose the framework (**BeautifulSoup/Scrapy/Playwright**), decide concurrency (**single-threaded vs async/worker queue**), and estimate resource requirements (**CPU/memory for headless browsers**).

**Q: When should I use async or queues?**  
A: Use **synchronous runs** for tiny jobs. Use **Scrapy/Twisted, asyncio workers, or task queues (Celery/RQ)** for medium-to-large jobs needing concurrency and retries.

---

## 4) Feasibility & Constraints → Anti-Bot, Legal, Cost

**Q: What checks must I run before I code?**  
A: Verify **robots.txt**, review site **Terms of Service**, and confirm any **login/anti-bot protections** (CAPTCHA, rate limits).

**Q: How should anti-bot measures affect my implementation?**  
A: Implement **polite crawling** (User-Agent, delays), add retry/backoff logic for 429s, and plan for **proxies/rotation** only if necessary — document cost and legal risk before using them.

**Q: What's a good compliance practice to include?**  
A: Store a **snapshot of robots.txt** and a short note on **ToS decisions** in the project repo for auditability.

---

## 5) Development & Testing → TDD, CI, QA

**Q: How does testing change my scraper development?**  
A: You should build a prototype and **unit/integration tests** for parsing logic so changes in HTML won’t silently break production runs.

**Q: What concrete tests and QA should I add?**  
A:  
- Unit tests for parsers (sample HTML → expected fields)  
- Integration tests using recorded pages (**VCR style**)  
- Robust logging  
- Error classification (**parse vs network**)  

**Q: What should I deliver early for client validation?**  
A: A **prototype sample (5–10 sanitized records)** to confirm schema and data quality before building the full pipeline.

---

## 6) Data Processing & Usage → Normalization, Dedupe, Evolution

**Q: How should downstream needs shape ETL?**  
A: Consumers determine transformations — timestamps, currency normalization, category mappings, dedupe rules, and any enrichment (geocoding, image links).

**Q: What concrete ETL features do I build?**  
A: **Clean → normalize → validate → store** steps, field-level validators, schema versioning, deduplication (**hashes or fuzzy matching**), and storage of raw crawl artifacts for debugging.

**Q: How do I make schema changes safe?**  
A: Add a **schema_version** to records and migrate consumers with **backwards-compatible transformations** when possible.

---

## 7) Automation & Maintenance → Deployment, Monitoring, Ops

**Q: How do automation and maintenance needs change deployment?**  
A: They determine scheduling tool (**cron vs Airflow**), deployment strategy (**Docker, Cloud Run, Kubernetes**), and required monitoring/alerting.

**Q: What monitoring and ops features should I add?**  
A: Track **errors per run, success rate, rows scraped, and schema drift**. Configure alerts (**Slack/email**) for failures or zero-row runs and automated retry policies.

**Q: What deployment pattern should I pick?**  
- **Small** → cron or simple Docker job  
- **Medium** → Airflow/Prefect on a VM or managed service  
- **Large** → Kubernetes with autoscaling and queueing (**RabbitMQ/Kafka**)  

---

## Example Setups — Q&A for Practical Stacks

**Q: What stack should I use for a small, one-off static site?**  
A: **requests + BeautifulSoup (or a simple Scrapy spider)**, single-threaded, write to **CSV or Google Sheet**, prototype 5–10 records, no scheduler.

**Q: What stack should I use for a medium ongoing project (JS pages, login)?**  
A: **Playwright (for rendering + auth)**, a headless browser pool, secure credential storage (**Vault/Secrets Manager**), rotating proxies if needed, **Postgres + S3** for raw, **Airflow/Prefect** for scheduling, and **Slack alerts + basic monitoring**.

**Q: What stack for enterprise/large scale?**  
A: **Distributed Scrapy/Playwright workers on Kubernetes**, queueing (**Kafka/RabbitMQ**), residential proxy pool, data lake (**S3/Parquet + BigQuery/Redshift**), **ELK/Prometheus** for observability, and **legal/compliance review**.

## Quick Checklist — Q&A to Run Before Writing Code

**Q: What must I have ready before coding?**  
A: A validated **JSON Schema**, sample URLs, client approval for prototype, storage chosen and provisioned, and acceptance criteria defined.

**Q: What tests & logging should I include from the start?**  
A: **Unit tests** for parsers, **integration tests** with recorded pages, **structured logs** (run_id, url, error_type), and a raw HTML archive for every run.

**Q: What operational items should I configure before launch?**  
A: Scheduler (**cron/Airflow**), alerts (**Slack/email**), retry policies, backup storage, and a simple runbook for common failures.
