# Case Studies for the Project: 
r'''

Problem Statement: 
1. Most in-demand hard skills.{Done}
2. High-demand locations for these roles. {Categorizing Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao}
3. Average salary ranges where available. {Proper Extraction for Php}
4. Common job requirements and qualifications. {Proper Extraction of Job Requirements means Longer Text}
5. Trends in skill demand over time.  {Continually Scrapping Things}
6. Overall job market health for Mechatronics-related careers. {Vague Goal}

Approach and Tool Used:
Playwright Libary
Pandas
Matpolot 
spaCy 

Challenges and How you Solved Them:
1. 


What Things i Should Focus on?
1. Study the Concept: 
2. Understanding the Code:
    A. History of the Code 
    B. Thought Proccess 
    C. What things i can do Better
3. Fix the Readme.md
4. Fix the Project Structure of the Code
5. Create a Config File 
    A. What Role of Job will it Scrape?
    B. What kind of files will it saved ? (csv,excel,json)
    C. What Database will it save mysql,sqllite, and MongoDB

    in "C" part Instead of hard-coding one database (like MySQL only), you make your scraper flexible with a config file (JSON, YAML, or .env). Then your script can read the config and decide:
        Should it save to MySQL?
        Or to SQLite?
        Or to MongoDB?
    # This means i can beflexible at things i can build that stuff to do things 
6. How i can Determine if the Project is Complete? 
    - I can Scrape the Website and their Data
    - Proper Project Structure
    - Proper README.md
No More Thinking Just Do it Man
    1. Create the README.md
        - Study the Concept of README.md
        - Properly Implement Things 
    2. Create the Case Study for the Project 
    3. Python Files:
        A. Put Python Files in the Proper Places (Proper Structure of Project)
        B. Understand the Code:
            1. Meaningful Names:
            2. Write the Why of Things (Why something it Done)
            3. Clean Code
            4. Write a Code that will save in JSON format
            5. Write a Code that will save in Excel Format 
            6. Write a Code that will save in MYSQL database and Google Sheet
            7. Write a code that have a Config files for the whole thing
            8. Write a Code for UI (Optional I think)
            9. History of the Code and the Thought Proccess and Reflection
            10. Find out what is the Reusable of Things in the Code that i can reuse
            11. Template for the Things that i want to Build 
                A. Data Cleaning 
                B. Data Extracting 
                C. Investigation in the Website 
    4. Create a Demo Video for the Things in here

# Storing Data: 
r'''
Export to CSV, Excel, JSON
Deliver clean, structured results (what clients want)
Push to databases (SQLite, MySQL, MongoDB)
'''

# You Can Package Work Professionally
r'''
Well-documented code (clear README, usage steps)
1. Configurable Scripts
'''


# What is Configurable Scripts? 
r'''
This means your scraper isn’t “hardcoded” — clients can easily change what they want to scrape without editing code.

❌ Bad:
url = "https://puregold.com/products/beverages"
Always scrapes beverages only. If the client wants “snacks” instead, they must edit your code.

✅ Good (Configurable):
category = input("Enter category to scrape (e.g., beverages, snacks, dairy): ")
url = f"https://puregold.com/products/{category}"

Command line arguments → python scraper.py --category snacks --pages 5
Config files (YAML/JSON) → client edits a simple settings file
Interactive menus → ask user inputs step by step
'''

# What does it mean by?
r'''
2. Clear Output Files
Most clients on Upwork aren’t programmers — they don’t want to look at raw JSON or messy logs.
They want ready-to-use data in a format they understand.

Example
✅ CSV/Excel (.csv, .xlsx) → clients can open in Excel/Google Sheets
✅ Clean tables (no duplicates, no broken rows)
✅ JSON (only if client is technical and asks for it)
'''

# Why this matter?
r'''
🔑 Why This Matters
Clients don’t care about code → they care about data they can use.
A script that is configurable + outputs clean files feels professional.
It reduces back-and-forth (client doesn’t need to ask you for every small change).
'''



# Overall Goals:
r'''
1. Fixing Properly the Jobs Scrapper
    A very Good Project 
2. Jump to the Next Project Where it Doesn't apply any Technical Skills a Challenge
Especially a Different Industries 
3. Package 1–2 projects into demo videos (screen recording of scraper running → saves client trust issues).
'''

r'''
🔑 1. Position Yourself Clearly

Decide your niche messaging:
Instead of “I do web scraping,” say:
→ “I help businesses collect clean, ready-to-use data from any website — products, jobs, or leads — delivered in Excel/CSV.”
Why? Clients like clear outcomes, not just “coding.”

🔑 2. Build a Professional Presence
Upwork Profile
Use a professional photo.
Write a strong headline:
“Web Scraping & Data Extraction Specialist | Python, Selenium, Scrapy”
Write an overview focused on benefits:
“I deliver accurate, structured data (CSV/Excel) from websites so you can focus on insights, not data collection.”
GitHub/Portfolio site
Put all your projects there.
Link it on your Upwork profile.

🔑 3. Learn Proposal Writing
Even with a great portfolio, if your proposals are weak, you won’t get jobs.
A strong proposal includes:
Personalized opener → Mention the client’s problem directly.
Show relevant experience → Link to a case study/project.
Explain your solution simply → Non-technical words, focus on results.
Call-to-action → Suggest a small next step:
“Can you share an example site so I can confirm feasibility?”

🔑 4. Start Building Trust Before Clients Hire You
Share mini-projects on LinkedIn/Twitter/GitHub → “Here’s a script I built that scrapes job listings into Excel.”
Offer free sample datasets (scraped from open/public data).
Consider doing 1–2 small free/discounted projects to get testimonials (outside Upwork or with friends).

🔑 5. Think Small at First
Don’t wait for a $500 gig.
Go for $20–50 jobs first → scrape 100–200 records → get reviews.
Reviews are more important than money in your first 3–5 jobs.

🔑 6. Systems for Efficiency
Even while new, build habits:
Template repo (configurable script + clean output) → reuse fast.
Proposal templates → just tweak per client.
Time tracking → learn how long a typical scrape takes (so you price better later).

🔑 7. Learn to “Qualify” Clients
Not all jobs are worth it.
Red flag jobs: “Scrape LinkedIn emails” (illegal/too risky), “Need 50k records in 1 day” (unrealistic).
Green flag jobs: “Scrape product details from XYZ shop and deliver in Excel” (clear + doable).
✅ So, in short:
While you’re building scrapers → package them into portfolio pieces + practice how to communicate them in a business way (profiles, proposals, mini-demos).

# How to Remember or rather become Familliar in your Code:

# Write a Meaningful name
r'''
Use clear variable, function, and class names:
When you see the code later, names already explain part of the logic.
'''
# Add Comments (But Not Too Many)
r'''
Comment on why something is done, not what it does (the code already shows the what).
'''
# Break Code into Small Functions
r'''
Functions act like "chapters in a book," so you only need to recall at a high level what each one does.
def load_data():
    ...
def clean_data():
    ...
def analyze_data():
    ...
'''
# Keep a Project Journal / README
r'''
Maintain a simple README.md or a personal log where you jot down:
    What the project does
    Key files and their purpose
    Any tricky parts
Next day, just skim your notes instead of the whole code.
'''
# Use Consistent Structure
r'''
Follow a predictable layout:
    Configs in one file
    Functions grouped logically
    Separate logic from data
Familiar structure = less re-learning
'''
# Commit with Good Git Messages
r'''
When you use Git, write messages like:
git commit -m "Added data cleaning step for missing values"
This creates a breadcrumb trail of your thought process.
'''
# Practice Writing “Clean Code”
r'''
The cleaner and simpler your code, the less mental overhead later.
Ask yourself: “Will future me understand this without coffee?”
