I Learned i can See the damn History of my Commit which is very Nice 
1. Working Demo 
2. I can Scale the Damn Code
3. I can Do Switching User Agent Thing 

Next Thing 
1. Delays a Randomize Delays
2. Human Behaviour 
    Randomize CLicking 
    Randomize Scrolling Thing 
3. Maybe Finger Printing 
4. Lastly Going to Big Description Thing The Final Boss of the Project thing 
    What i want to do is text parsing + keyword extraction + categorization.
    1. Extracting relevant sections (e.g., ‚ÄúQualifications‚Äù, ‚ÄúRequirements‚Äù, ‚ÄúSkills‚Äù)
2. Identifying and categorizing keywords (hard skills, soft skills, nice-to-haves)
3. Counting keyword occurrences (like ‚ÄúPLC‚Äù frequency for mechatronics career tracking)



Reflection I'm Still Dependable in AI and there are Concept and Practice i needed to learn 
1. Zip 
2. Next Page Thing 
3. Handling Exception and Error in my Code for more Robustness 
4. Skills In CSS and Xpath thing 
5. How to Commit Things

Forgot to Put Something in August 7 

But In August 8 I think i needed to Do some Research on What is a Timeline in Creating a Project in Webscrapping a Realistic Timeline and i will try to do it fast enough
Because i have a Whole Day of Doing it and i needed to proccess the Information Faster and Create Something for myself in that 

I'm Going to Start to Work Right now: 
1. Devfining the PRoject Scope 

# I learn that Why do i need a Frequent or Once in term of Web Scrapping 
# In Terms of Demand i will putmyself where there are Currently needed which is the Frequent thing to do

'''

# August 4 -6
r'''
Pure Writing and Searching about "Meta" like getting experience and stuffl like
that and not actually working at things but after the term Test i will hit this project hard 
But right now at least i want to create a commit to get streak in the github

its like i'm working in this project in a Indirect Way of how i should do things here 

'''

# August 3

* Learning the DevTools More about things that are Important for Web Scrapping 
There are a lot of Things in Dev Tools That are Quite Important i thank my past self for learning API 
i have some idea on how to do things in there man

    1. Learning to Investigate a Website First Before Touching  a code
        A. Understanding robot.txt (Done)
        B. Can i somehow Read the robot.txt or automate it in python? 
        C. Understanding Incognito and Browser Investigation in Website
        D. Learning the Dev Tools for Furthermore Investigation of the Website
Learning to Investigate or Recon of the Website before touching the code to know how to do the Workflow (Medium - High Energy Level)
    This Means i can Do it in the Morning or Afternoon for Energy Management

I want to Learn and Analyze a Website in terms of Legality whether i can scrape it or not

Learning the Gray Area of Web Scrapping and The Legality of Web Scrapping 
    1. Scrapping a Third Party Website : "Jora" Similar to the other Website like Jobstreet or Even Linkdiln because i had no idea how to navigate things in terms of legality
    2. 

Fixing the Github of Why i can't just upload things in there 
    "
    üí° Only push your code and essential files to GitHub. 
    Keep large or system-specific folders (like venv/) out using .gitignore. Use requirements.txt to share your environment.

    Measurable: 
         I think in terms of History i will measure it but i lacking of Time for this 

        Phase: 
            1. Defining The Objective
            2. Target Website: "Jobstreet.ph"
            3. Careful Experimenting to not Get blocked


    Actionable: 
        # I'm currently Thinking that should i always write the SMARTER goal for every Project The Heck 
   1. Putting VENV :  python -m venv job_venv
   job_venv\Scripts\activate
   2. Installing the Playwright: 
        a. pip install playwright ‚úÖ 2. Install Playwright
        b. playwright install # ‚úÖ 3. Install the required browser binaries

    3. Defining What Things i should scrape: 
        Job title
        Company name
        Location (city, country, remote status)
        Posting date (e.g., ‚Äú2 days ago‚Äù)
        Job description
        Employment type (full‚Äëtime, part‚Äëtime, contract)
        Salary range (if disclosed)
        Application URL/link
        Requirements/qualifications
        Tags/categories (e.g., Developer, Customer Service)
        On some platforms (e.g., Kalibrr, OnlineJobs.ph), you might also scrape:
        Resume snippets or skill matrices
        Assessment results (Kalibrr)
        Employer ratings or chat metadata (Bossjob)

    4. Goal Statement:
        To identify the most in-demand hard skills for Mechatronics or Automation Engineer roles in the Philippines by scraping job listings from relevant local job websites.
            A. Collecting job listings related to Mechatronics and Automation Engineering.
            B. Extracting job titles, descriptions, and particularly required skills.
            C. Analyzing the frequency of specific hard skills (e.g., PLC programming, AutoCAD, MATLAB).
            D. Producing insights about which skills are most frequently demanded, helping guide skill development or hiring strategy.

    üß≠ Process to Define and Achieve the Goal
    Here‚Äôs how you define and implement this project step-by-step:

    1. Clarify Your Research Questions (Define Goal Precisely)
        * Break your broad idea into concrete questions:
        * What are the most frequently mentioned hard skills in job listings for Mechatronics or Automation Engineers?
        * Which companies or industries are hiring the most for these roles?
        * How do skill demands vary between locations or job levels?

    2. Identify Target Websites for Scraping
        Find Philippine-based job portals that list engineering jobs:
        JobStreet Philippines (https://www.jobstreet.com.ph/)
        Indeed Philippines (https://ph.indeed.com/)
        Kalibrr (https://www.kalibrr.com/)
        LinkedIn Jobs (PH location filtered)

    3. Determine Data to Collect (Data Fields)
        For each job listing, collect:
            Job Title
            Company Name
            Location
            Posted Date
            Job Description
            Skills / Requirements (Key Field!)
            Employment Type (optional)
            Seniority Level (optional)

    4. Store the Data
        Store the scraped data in:
        A local CSV or JSON file for initial analysis
        Or a database like SQLite or MongoDB for scalability
     
    5. Clean and Parse the Data
    Focus especially on:
        Cleaning messy text
        Tokenizing and extracting hard skills from job descriptions
        Example: using keyword matching (e.g., ["PLC", "AutoCAD", "SCADA", "Python", "SolidWorks"]) or NLP

    6. Analyze the Data
        Use Pandas or SQL to count frequencies of skills
        Plot using Matplotlib or Seaborn

    7. Interpret & Visualize Results
        Create visual insights like:
        Bar chart of Top 10 In-Demand Skills
        Word cloud from job descriptions
        Time-series if you scrape over weeks/months
