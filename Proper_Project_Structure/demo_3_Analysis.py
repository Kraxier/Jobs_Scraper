software_names = [SoftwareName.CHROME.value, SoftwareName.FIREFOX.value]
r'''
SoftwareName is an Enum (presumably). .value gets the actual value (like "chrome" or "firefox").

software_names becomes a list of the software/browser names you want the UA rotator to pick from.
'''
operating_systems = [OperatingSystem.WINDOWS.value, OperatingSystem.LINUX.value]
r'''
Same idea for OS enum values (e.g. "Windows", "Linux"). These tell the rotator which OS strings to include in generated user agents.
'''

                               limit=100)
r'''
RandomUA(...) instantiates a rotator object (custom class or third-party) that can supply random user-agent strings.

software_names and operating_systems restrict which parts the rotator will vary.

limit=100 probably controls how many UAs the rotator will pre-generate / cache or the pool size. (Exact meaning depends on the RandomUA implementation.)

        print(f"[WARNING] fake_useragent failed: {e}")
        return fallback_ua_rotator.get_random_user_agent()
r'''
get_user_agent() tries to use UserAgent() (commonly from the fake_useragent package) to get a random, realistic user agent via ua.random.

If that fails (network, package error, bad cache, etc.), it prints a warning and falls back to fallback_ua_rotator.get_random_user_agent() ‚Äî i.e., the RandomUA instance you created earlier.

This makes the function resilient: if fake_useragent is unavailable, your scraper still gets a UA string instead of crashing.

Recommendation: 
1. button.is_visible() can raise if the locator matches multiple elements or gets detached.
* Prefer checking button.count() or use button.first and locator.wait_for() for stable behavior.

2. Infinite loop risk / stuck on same page
If navigation fails or the site returns the same URL, you may loop forever. Keep a visited set or max_pages counter.

r'''
Reusing a single user_agent for entire run: You pick one UA string at start. That‚Äôs OK, but rotating UA per search or periodically can reduce pattern detection. Don‚Äôt change UA per request too frequently or produce invalid UAs.
Page state reset: You call page.goto(base_url) before each search; good for resetting but you might want to context.clear_cookies() or recreate context if the site tracks sessions.

Before Interacting: 
Use wait_for_selector() or locator.wait_for() before interacting.
'''

r'''
Top priorities (do these first)

Guarantee resource cleanup (CSV & browser)

Why: Prevent corrupted CSVs and leaked browser processes on errors.

What to do: Use try/finally (or context managers) to always close() the CSV and browser. You already use with sync_playwright() ‚Äî ensure CSV close is in an outer finally.

One-line fix: wrap scrape_jora_title() body in try/finally and call csv_file.close() in finally. (Your hardened refactor has this.)

Create and reuse UserAgent() once

Why: UserAgent() can be slow and error-prone if created per call.

What to do: Initialize once at module import and reuse; fallback to RandomUA when it fails. Add optional locking for threads.

Example:

try:
    _FAKE_UA = UserAgent()
except Exception:
    _FAKE_UA = None

def get_user_agent():
    if _FAKE_UA:
        try: return _FAKE_UA.random
        except Exception: pass
    return fallback_ua_rotator.get_random_user_agent()


Protect Playwright operations with robust waits

Why: time.sleep() races and wait_for_selector raises on timeout ‚Äî both lead to brittle scrapers.

What to do: Prefer locator.wait_for(state="visible", timeout=...), element_handle snapshotting for lists, and try/except around waits to handle TimeoutError specifically.

Avoid index drift: snapshot element handles for loop

Why: Clicking can change DOM order, causing locator.nth(i) to point at the wrong element or a detached node.

What to do: Use element_handles() once per page, shuffle handles, and operate on handles (hover/click) instead of re-querying by index.

Make pagination robust (click instead of href, visited set, max_pages)

Why: Href-less JS pagination, loops, and stuck navigation.

What to do: Prefer next_button.click() when possible; maintain visited URL set and max_pages guard.

Reliability & robustness (next items)

Flush + close file safely; consider csv.DictWriter

Keep using flush() to avoid data loss; optionally csv.DictWriter for readability/column safety.

Add per-job and per-search counters / logging

Track pages scraped, rows written, fallback UA usage. Helps debug blocking or scale issues.

Trim/limit enormous text when logging

Print only first ~300 chars of descriptions to keep console readable.

Handle modals/popups gracefully

Use locator.first and wait_for(state="visible") then click() inside try/except to dismiss.

Add polite jitter and rate-limits

Random sleeps between interactions and between searches (you already do some). Consider await/time.sleep ranges tuned to the site.

Maintainability & architecture (medium term)

Encapsulate scraper into a class

Put writer, csv_file, UA, counters into a JoraScraper class. Cleaner state management and easier unit tests.

Make configuration explicit

Move constants (selectors, timeouts, UA rotation flag, max_pages) to a config object or top of file.

Return statistics from functions

Let pagination() return (pages_scraped, rows_written) and aggregate per search. Makes monitoring simpler.

Add resume capability

Save progress (e.g., last keyword index) to a small JSON checkpoint file so you can resume after interruption.

Add tests & dry-run mode

Unit test small parts (parsing, safe_text), and a dry-run mode that runs on a saved sample HTML page.

Scalability & performance (later)

Parallelize cautiously

If you later do parallel searches, open separate browser contexts per worker, and write to separate CSVs or synchronize writes.

Consider saving long descriptions separately

If descriptions are very large, consider saving them to files (or compressed columns) and refer by id in CSV.

Monitoring / alerting

Log to a file and optionally report when fallback UA used > X times or when scraping stops prematurely.

Safety, ethics & legal

Respect robots.txt and terms of service

Make sure the site allows scraping. If unsure, ask for permission or throttle to be polite.

Be prepared for CAPTCHAs

If the site uses bot detection, consider back-off strategies or avoid scraping at scale.
