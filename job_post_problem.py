# Some Motivation for my Journey Towards Data Engineer üõ†Ô∏è or Even Data Analyst üìä

r'''
1. Data Engineer üõ†Ô∏è
Focus: Building and maintaining data pipelines so data flows cleanly into systems.
Where you overlap:
    Web scraping is essentially building a data ingestion pipeline ‚Äî a core Data Engineer skill.
    You‚Äôre designing how raw, messy data (job posts) gets collected, cleaned, and stored so it‚Äôs ready for analysis.
'''

r'''
2. Data Analyst üìä
Focus: Turning structured data into insights to answer business questions.
Where you overlap:
Once you‚Äôve scraped and cleaned the job posts, you‚Äôll analyze:

    Top 10 skills for Mechatronics
    Salary distribution by city
    Trends in demand for ‚ÄúPLC programming‚Äù over time
Creating visualizations: bar charts, heat maps, trend lines.
Example in your project:
    Grouping job posts by skill and counting occurrences.
    Calculating average salary per location.
    Making a skills heat map.
