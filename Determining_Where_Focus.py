########### Concepts:
# The Minimum Extra in Data Cleaning and Transformation
r'''
âœ… Why Your List is Essential (The "Minimum Extra"):
Duplicates: Crucial for data accuracy.

Empty Rows/Columns: Ensures data density and usability.
Simple Formatting: ($1,000 â†’ 1000, whitespace) makes data machine-readable.
Data Types: Prevents analysis errors (e.g., numbers stored as text).
Standardization: ("NY" â†’ "New York") enables consistent reporting.
Reshaping/Conversion: Meets client's requested format (Excel, CSV).
'''
r'''
ðŸ“Œ Key Skills to Master Beyond Basics:
1. Pandas (Python): For complex transformations, merging, grouping, and advanced string operations.
2. Regular Expressions (RegEx): Essential for extracting patterns from messy text.
3. Data Validation Libraries: Like Pydantic (Python) or Joi (JS) for strict schema enforcement.
4. APIs for Enrichment: Currency exchange APIs, geocoding APIs (for addresses).
5. Error Logging & Reporting: Documenting what cleaning was done and where issues persist.
6. Communication: Discussing edge cases with clients ("How should we handle 'Price on Application'?").
'''

ðŸ”¥ What's Often Missing (The "Professional Extra"):
These elevate your work from technically correct to client-ready:

1. Advanced Error Detection & Handling:
Hidden Characters: Non-breaking spaces ( ), invalid Unicode, HTML remnants (&amp;).
Unexpected Formats: Dates like "Yesterday" or "Jan 15th"; prices like "Free" or "Contact for price".
Logical Inconsistencies: Product price exists, but "Out of Stock". Negative prices. Future-dated "last updated" timestamps.

2. Contextual Cleaning & Enrichment:
Units Conversion: "1.5kg" â†’ 1500 (grams), "10 miles" â†’ 16.09 (km) â€“ if client needs standardization.
Currency Conversion: Extract currency symbol/ISO code & convert to client's base currency (requires exchange rates).
Address Parsing: Splitting "123 Main St, New York, NY 10001" into separate columns (Street, City, State, Zip).
Categorization: Assigning product reviews ("Great!") to sentiment scores (Positive: 4/5).

3. Robust Validation & Quality Checks:
Completeness Checks: Verify expected fields exist in every record.
Plausibility Ranges: Do prices fit the product category? Are dates within a logical range?
Schema Validation: Ensure data structure matches the client's specification exactly.
Cross-Field Validation: Does "Sale End Date" come after "Sale Start Date"?

4. Handling Dynamic/Messy Sources:
Inconsistent Structure: Pages where the same data point appears in different HTML elements/locations.
Multi-Format Data: Text containing prices, dates, and measurements mixed together.
Partial Data: Handling missing images, optional fields, or conditional sections gracefully.

5. Metadata & Traceability:
Source URL: Including the exact page URL for each record (critical for auditing).
Scrape Timestamp: When was this specific data point collected?
Error Flags: Marking records/fields where cleaning assumptions were applied or extraction failed.

6. Client-Specific Business Rules:
Custom Filtering: Exclude test products, specific sellers, or outdated entries based on client criteria.
Field Mapping: Renaming "prod_name" â†’ "Product Name (Client Spec)".
Value Mapping: Applying client's internal category codes instead of scraped labels.

1. Advanced Error Detection & Handling
Example: Scraping product data from an e-commerce site

Hidden Characters:
Raw scraped text: "Organic Cotton T-Shirt &amp;nbsp; (Unisex)"
â†’ Cleaned: "Organic Cotton T-Shirt (Unisex)"
Fix: Removed HTML entity &amp;nbsp; and extra spaces.

Unexpected Formats:
Price field: "$1,200", "1.199â‚¬", "Contact for Price"
â†’ Cleaned: 1200, 1199, NULL + flag column price_availability: ["available", "available", "on_request"]
Logic: Handle multi-currency symbols and non-numeric values.

Logical Inconsistencies:
stock_status: "In Stock" + price: 0 + description: "Temporarily unavailable"
â†’ Flagged row with data_warning: "Conflict: price=0 but marked 'In Stock'".

2. Contextual Cleaning & Enrichment
Example: Real estate listings

Units Conversion:
Raw: "1,500 sq ft", "0.5 acres"
â†’ Standardized: 139.35 mÂ², 2,023.43 mÂ²
Note: Client needed metric units for analysis.

Address Parsing:
Raw: "123 Maple St #4B, Brooklyn, NY 11201"
â†’ Enriched:

json
{
  "street": "123 Maple St",
  "unit": "#4B",
  "city": "Brooklyn",
  "state": "NY",
  "zip": "11201",
  "latitude": 40.6943,
  "longitude": -73.9862
}
Tool: Used Python's geopy for geocoding.

Categorization:
Raw review: "The agent was rude but the apartment is perfect!"
â†’ Sentiment scores:
agent_sentiment: negative, property_sentiment: positive.

3. Robust Validation & Quality Checks
Example: Hotel booking data

Plausibility Ranges:
room_price: 10 (too low) or room_price: 10000 (too high)
â†’ Flagged: price_anomaly: true
Rule: Prices outside $50â€“$2,000 require review.

Cross-Field Validation:
check_in: 2025-12-01, check_out: 2025-11-30
â†’ Rejected with error: "check_out date before check_in".

Completeness Check:
Required fields: [name, price, rating]
â†’ Added missing_fields column: "rating" (if rating is empty).

4. Handling Dynamic/Messy Sources
Example: News article scraping

Inconsistent Structure:
Author appears in:
<div class="author">, <meta property="article:author">, or "By John Doe" in body text
â†’ Strategy: Check 3 possible selectors + regex fallback: r"By\s([A-Z][a-z]+\s[A-Z][a-z]+)".

Multi-Format Data:
Date strings: "March 5, 2024", "2 days ago", "2024-03-05T12:00:00Z"
â†’ Unified: 2024-03-05
Tool: dateparser.parse() with relative base date.

5. Metadata & Traceability
Example: Competitor price monitoring

Source URL & Timestamp:
Added columns:
source_url: "https://shop.com/product-123",
scraped_at: "2025-08-19 14:30:00 UTC".
Why: Client detected price discrepancies and needed to audit sources.

Error Flags:
price_imputed: true (if missing price was inferred from similar products) + imputation_notes: "Used median category price".

6. Client-Specific Business Rules
Example: Pharmaceutical product catalog

Custom Filtering:
Raw data includes veterinary products.
â†’ Removed rows where category == "Animal Health" per client's requirements.

Value Mapping:
Raw: "Dosage: 200mg"
â†’ Client's internal format:
dosage_value: 200, dosage_unit: "mg", client_sku: "MED-200MG-BX1".

Field Renaming:
Scraped field "price_after_discount" â†’ client's expected field "net_price".

Key Takeaway:
These "Professional Extra" steps transform raw scraped data into decision-ready intelligence. For instance:

A real estate client doesnâ€™t just get "addresses" â€“ they get geocoded, standardized, enriched property records ready for mapping tools.

An e-commerce client doesnâ€™t just get "prices" â€“ they get validated, currency-normalized, anomaly-checked data fed directly into pricing algorithms.
