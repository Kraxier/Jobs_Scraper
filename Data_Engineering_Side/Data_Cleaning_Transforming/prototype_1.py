r'''
Realization: 
Where to Clean the Data in terms of that what type of files?
    - The Top Choice for Cleaning and Post Processing is
    1. CSV (Comma Seperated Values) 
        - Most Common and Universal Choice for Tabular data.
        - Human Readaable
        - Wide Software Support 
        - Simple Structure that it force your JSON data into a flat tabular strucutre.
        which is often necessary for analysis and machine learning.
'''

r'''
To STORE RAW DATA for cleaning: JSONL is best. It's your immutable source.
To DO THE CLEANING: It happens in memory using a programming language (Python/Pandas). The file format is irrelevant at this stage; it's all about data structures.
To SAVE THE CLEANED RESULT: CSV (for most cases) or Parquet (for large, efficient datasets) is best.

# df = pd.read_json('Mechatronics_2025-08-30.jsonl')+

# Display the first few rows to check the data
print(df.head())

r'''
My Question is what if the file are in different folders? 

* df = pd.read_json("data/2025/Mechatronics_2025-08-30.jsonl", lines=True)
C:/Users/Name/Documents/Mechatronics_2025-08-30.jsonl).

* lines=True: This is the crucial parameter that tells pandas the file is in JSON Lines format, 
where each line is a separate JSON object

* pd.read_json(): This is the pandas function for reading JSON files.

Traceback:
    1. Is one of the Asernal Tools of Debugging Skills that you have, it can let you know 
    where your program(which line broke) didn't work and why
    2. Root Cause Analysis, sometimes the bug isn't in the line itself but it is something 
    Traceback help you show the whole picture of things 
    3. Learning that over time , you can start recognizing the common errors and fix them faste

    r'''
    re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)
        * re.sub() is a function from the re module (regular expressions).
            * It searches for all matches of pattern in string and replaces them with replacement.

        * The pattern: r'\s+'
            * \s means any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.).
            * + means one or more occurrences.
            * So \s+ matches any sequence of whitespace (like " ", "\n\t", etc.).
            * Basically the \s is for white space, tab and newline
            * + for more occurence in a single text 
            * and all replace ment will be replace with a single space " "
        
        Example: text = "This   is \n   a   test."
        cleaned = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
        output : This is a test.

# .strip()
r'''
It’s a built-in Python string method
Removes leading and trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from a string.
    * Only at the End and Beginning 
    Examples: text = "   Hello world!   \n"
    Output: Hello world!

It's Differ from the re.sub because strip() clean the beginning and end (edges)
While the re.sub clean the middle one

text = "   Hello    world   \n  "

print("strip:", text.strip())  
# 'Hello    world'

print("re.sub:", re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text))  
# ' Hello world '
