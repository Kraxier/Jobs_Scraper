collaborate with logistics, spare parts, and technical support teams to ensure full support readiness on day 1.
maintain and enforce a service readiness checklist as a mandatory npdi gate.
lead or support field trials, pilot deployments, and feedback integration for design refinement before mass rollout.
participate in or lead fmea and reliability engineering reviews focused on serviceability and field failure prevention.
define internal service readiness best practices and standard workflows for future npdi programs.

qualifications

bachelor's degree in mechanical, electrical, or mechatronics engineering (or related discipline).

strong understanding of the npdi/npi process from a serviceability and lifecycle support standpoint.
proven ability to work across global teams including engineering, service, logistics, and technical documentation.
experience with bom structuring, service documentation, and tools like solidworks, autocad, windchill, or sap.

preferred skills

familiarity with ups and sts/ats topologies, battery chemistries (li-ion, vrla), and bms architecture.
